# Empircal Approach
K-S test in multiple dimension using Conditional expectation.

# Semi-parametric approach

```dots
 digraph G{
 A -> B;
 A [label="Kernel Estimation"];
 B [label="Comparison"];
 }
```

# Shapiro–Wilk test

R(mvtnorm) uses this approach.

Empirical testing (JSMA, 2012, 2: 21–33) has found that Shapiro–Wilk has the best power for a given significance,
followed closely by 

1. Anderson–Darling    
2. Kolmogorov–Smirnov    
3. Lilliefors    
4. Anderson–Darling tests.
